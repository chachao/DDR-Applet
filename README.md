# DDR-Applet
This applet was based on the game Dance Dance Revolution. It was created as a coding project for fun and to improve coding skills. It was made with Java and using the Greenfoot platform. I do not own any of the images or audio files used in this project. 

Upon reflection, there are several things that should be changed about this project.
  1) Increase memory space - In order to work, the applet must have predefined songs and images stored inside. 
  2) Improve the counter functionality - the counter is used as a metronome and helps determine when to send up the game arrows.      Although it works at the moment, it is not completely in sync with the song or accurate. One way to improve it would be to 
     develop an algorithm to launch arrows at a specific beat for a song's time signature. 
  3) Instead of defining everything inside the applet, use an intialization file to store everything - this will make the 
     startup of the applet much faster and will help free up some memory.
  4) Optimize code - since this program was created just to develop coding skills, the algorithms in place are not very 
     efficient. It would be better to fix some of the loops and costly operations in the applet.
